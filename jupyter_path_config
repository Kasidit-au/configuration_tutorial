Open jupyter notebook with specified path:

when we want to open  jupyter notebook inside desired path, we usually type cd path in command prompt or anaconda prompt but this takes time.

So what we can do is the following steps:

1. write script in notepad

ECHO ON
call C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat
cd C:\Users\kasiditp\Desktop\python
jupyter notebook

2. save as .bat file

3. click on this file when we want to use jupyter notebook
